# CPM
This repository is meant to publish codes relating to computations of aggregate packing densities and corresponding segregation potentials using the compressible packing model (CPM)

This Mathematica code serves as a support resource for a manuscript targeted for a journal paper, titled: 
"Prediction of Optimum Packing Density of Multi-sized Aggregates using Grading Models and Compressible Packing Model"
By

Some of the code lines contain direct references to the equation number in the raw manuscript for the above manuscript.

Users without a Mathematica desktop license can view the file using the freely available Wolfram player (https://www.wolfram.com/player/).
Alternatively, obtaining a free 'Basic' Wolfram cloud account (https://www.wolframcloud.com/).
With the Basic Plan, users can copy the codes from Player to the cloud notebook for execution, or simply log in and then
access the published version of this code on the Wolfram Cloud, available at https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/saheedka/Published/CPM.nb.
Making a personal copy of the codes allows a user to run the code on the Woldfram Cloud computing platform
